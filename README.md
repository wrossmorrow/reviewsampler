# reviewsampler

A simple node.js server to ("balanced-uniformly") sample from a list of reviews in a Google Sheet. 

## Setup

Obviously you need `node.js` and `npm` to handle this repo. Install by running

```
npm install
```

in the repo directory. I run with

```
$ ./reviewsampler.start
... do other stuff, until we need to stop with:
$ ./reviewsampler.stop
```
